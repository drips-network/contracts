/// The process stops automatically when the drips balance is not enough to cover another second.
///
/// Every user has a receiver balance, in which they have funds received from other users.

/// to drip received funds they need to be first collected and then added to the drips balance.
///
/// The user can share collected funds with other users by using splits.
/// When collecting, the user gives each of their splits receivers a fraction of the received funds.
