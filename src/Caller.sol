/// @notice A generic call executor increasing flexibility of other smart contracts' APIs.
/// It offers 3 main features, which can be mixed and matched for even more flexibility:
/// - Authorizing addresses to act on behalf of other addresses
/// - Support for EIP-712 messages
/// - Batching calls
///
/// `Caller` adds these features to the APIs of all smart contracts reading the message
/// sender passed as per ERC-2771 and accepting this contract as a trusted forwarder.
/// To all other contracts `Caller` adds a feature of batching calls
/// for all functions tolerating `msg.sender` being an instance of `Caller`.
///
/// Usage examples:
/// - Batching sequences of calls to a contract.
/// The contract API may consist of many functions which need to be called in sequence,
/// but it may not offer a composite functions performing exactly that sequence.
/// It's expensive, slow and unreliable to create a separate transaction for each step.
/// To solve that problem create a batch of calls and submit it to `callBatched`.
/// - Batching sequences of calls to multiple contracts.
/// It's a common pattern to submit an ERC-2612 permit to approve a smart contract
/// to spend the user's ERC-20 tokens before running that contract's logic.
/// Unfortunately unless the contract's API accepts signed messages for the token it requires
/// creating two separate transactions making it as inconvenient as a regular approval.
/// The solution is again to use `callBatched` because it can call multiple contracts.
/// Just create a batch first calling the ERC-20 contract and then the contract needing the tokens.
/// - Setting up a proxy address.
/// Sometimes a secure but inconvenient to use address like a cold wallet
/// or a multisig needs to have a proxy or an operator.
/// That operator is temporarily trusted, but later it must be revoked or rotated.
/// To achieve this first `authorize` the proxy using the safe address and then use that proxy
/// to act on behalf of the secure address using `callAs`.
/// Later, when the proxy address needs to be revoked, either the secure address or the proxy itself
/// can `unauthorize` the proxy address and maybe `authorize` another address.
/// - Setting up operations callable by others.
/// Some operations may benefit from being callable either by trusted addresses or by anybody.
/// To achieve this deploy a smart contract executing these operations
/// via `callAs` and, if you need that too, implementing a custom authorization.
/// Finally, `authorize` this smart contract to act on behalf of your address.
/// - Batching dynamic sequences of calls.
/// Some operations need to react dynamically to the state of the blockchain.
/// For example an unknown amount of funds is retrieved from a smart contract,
/// which then needs to be dynamically split and used for different purposes.
/// To do this, first deploy a smart contract performing that logic.
/// Next, call `callBatched` which first calls `authorize` on the `Caller` itself authorizing
/// the new contract to perform `callAs`, then calls that contract and finally `unauthorize`s it.
/// This way the contract can perform any logic it needs on behalf of your address, but only once.
/// - Gasless transactions.
/// It's an increasingly common pattern to use smart contracts without necessarily spending Ether.
/// This is achieved with gasless transactions where the wallet signs an ERC-712 message
/// and somebody else submits the actual transaction executing what the message requests.
/// It may be executed by another wallet or by an operator
/// expecting to be repaid for the spent Ether in other assets.
/// You can achieve this with `callSigned`, which allows anybody
/// to execute a call on behalf of the signer of a message.
/// `Caller` doesn't deal with gas, so if you're using a gasless network,
/// it may require you to specify the gas needed for the entire call execution.
/// - Executing batched calls with authorization or signature.
/// You can use both `callAs` and `callSigned` to call `Caller` itself,
/// which in turn can execute batched calls on behalf of the authorizing or signing address.
/// It also applies to `authorize` and `unauthorize`, they too can be called using
/// `callAs`, `callSigned` or `callBatched`.
